# churn_prediction

The project was made as self-project to learn to explore datasets taken from kaggles on customer behavior analysis on telecommunication company and I also try to predict customer churn based on several features using several machine learning model (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest Classifier) and got 95.3 % accuracy score using Random Forest.

I also made article to explain my finding in Mediums. Link Here : https://medium.com/@Pudja_Gemilang/analisis-dan-prediksi-customer-churn-pada-perusahaan-telekomunikasi-988ab4925132
